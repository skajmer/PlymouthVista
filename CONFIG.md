# Configuration:
For keys, refer to [this section of this documentation.](#keys)

## Configuring with pv_conf.sh:
`pv_conf.sh` is a script that helps to configure the theme. This script is already used for the fading effect, showing the hibernation screen and installing the theme.

- Compile the theme,
> [!WARNING]
> If you have an existing PlymouthVista installation, you also need to pass option `-i`, which accepts the `/path/of/the/new/PlymouthVista.script` file for the commands below. By passing the `-i` option, you won't be overwriting your existing installation.
- Run `./pv_conf.sh -l` to verify if it shows anything. This command displays every key and value pair from your compiled script.
- To get the value of a key, use `./pv_conf.sh -g {key}` to display the value of the key.
- To modify the value of a key, use `./pv_conf.sh -g {key} -v {value}`, which will modify the value of the key.
- After you've finished the configuration and want to install the theme, you may want to pass the `-s` option to skip questions that are related to basic configuration.


## Configuring by modifying the source:
You can also modify `/path/of/the/PlymouthVista/src/plymouth_config.sp`. 

> [!WARNING]
> You are directly modifying the PlymouthVista's source code. Please be careful about the syntax!

> [!WARNING]
> Do not remove the `global.` prefix. It's mandatory!

- Modify the `plymouth_config.sp` for your own taste. Only modify the parts like these:
- - `global.KeepTheKey = "modify here";` 
- - `global.KeepTheKeyAndModifyTheIntegerOnly = 1;`
- Then, run `./compile.sh`.
- After that, install the theme with `install.sh`. You may also want to pass the `-s` option to skip questions that are related to basic configuration.
